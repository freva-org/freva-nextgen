Freva, the free evaluation system framework, is a data search and analysis
platform developed by the atmospheric science community for the atmospheric
science community. With help of Freva researchers can:

- quickly and intuitively search for data stored at typical data centers that
  host many datasets.
- create a common interface for user defined data analysis tools.
- apply data analysis tools in a reproducible manner.

About this Documentation
------------------------
This documentation describes the *freva-client* library, its
command line interface (cli) and the REST API. The *freva-client* library
described in this documentation only support searching for data. If you
need to apply data analysis plugins, please visit the
`official documentation <https://freva-org.github.io/freva>`_

.. _install+configure:

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

Installation of the client library is straight forward and can be achieved via:

.. code:: console

    python3 -m pip install freva-client

After successful installation you will also have to following command line
interfaces (cli) available:

.. code:: console

    freva-client --help

.. execute_code::
   :hide_code:

   from subprocess import run, PIPE
   res = run(["freva-client", "--help"], check=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
   print(res.stdout.decode())


Configuration
+++++++++++++

The client library needs to make connections to the freva server. You can either
set the server host names by using the ``host`` arguments (or ``--host`` flags
in the cli) to make connections or permanently set the freva server host name.
To do so you have several options:

- If you are using the centrally administered freva instance you don't have to
  do anything.
- If on the other hand you have installed the client library yourself you can
  use the ``freva.toml`` configuration located in the user config directory
  (``.config/freva/freva.toml``)
- You can also set the ``FREVA_CONFIG`` environment variable to point to
  any location of the ``freva.toml`` file

The configuration file itself follows `toml syntax <https://toml.io>`_. After
installation you will have freva config file with the following content
placed in the user configuration directory of your OS (e.g ``~/.config/freva``
on Linux):

.. code:: toml

    ## The new freva configuration file.
    ## This configuration files follows toml (https://toml.io) syntax and replaces
    ## the old evaluation_system.conf file.
    #
    [freva]
    ## This section configures the freva client. All settings related to freva
    ## are set here.
    ##
    ## The name of the specific freva instance. If you use multiple configurations
    ## for different freva instances the `project_name` entry allows you to
    ## later identify which configuration you were using.
    # project_name = "freva"

    ##
    ## The host that runs the freva api system. In most cases this is just the
    ## url of the freva webpage, such as https://www.freva.dkrz.de.
    ## You can set a port by separating <hostname:port>
    ## for example freva.example.org:7777
    # host = ""

To permanently set or override the freva server host name you have to set
the ``host`` variable in that file. In most cases this variable can be
set to the url of the freva web site you are using, for example
https://www.freva.dkrz.de.
