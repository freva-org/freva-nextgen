This repository contains the *freva-rest services* defining rest endpoints
that make up the freva server services as well as the client
services that provide command line interfaces and python libraries for their
rest service counterparts.

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> A manual setup of the service will most likely fail. You should set up this
> service via the [freva-deployment](https://freva-deployment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
> routine.
