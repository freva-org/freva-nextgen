# Default configuration file for the REST API server.
#
# This file configures the REST API, specifying which services to enable,
# database connections, caching options, and authentication details.
# Adjust these settings as per your deployment requirements.

[restAPI]
# Setting for the freva-rest api are configured in this section.

# List of services the API should provide.
# - `databrowser`: Enables the search functionality, allowing users to search
#   and retrieve metadata related to available datasets.
# - `zarr-stream`: Provides streaming access to data in Zarr format, suitable
#   for large, multi-dimensional arrays often used in scientific data.
# By default, both services are enabled. Remove a service from the list
# to disable it if not required for your API instance.

# Specify a reverse proxy URL if the server is only accessible through a proxy.
# This can help configure the API to respond with correct URLs when deployed
# behind a reverse proxy.
# Example: If the server is located at `my-server.example.com:7777` but
# is accessed publicly via `https://www.my-server.org`, set `proxy` to
# "https://www.my-server.org". Leave this empty if no reverse proxy is used.

### IMPORTANT: If you uncomment the whole configuration below, you can use 
## the secondary-backend for connecting to all kind of Rational Database
## Management System (RDBMS) backend and search engine (SE) backend like
## Elasticsearch or OpenSearch. You can uncomment one of the following
## sections based on the backend you want to connect to.

# # PostgreSQL Configuration

# [secondary-backend]
# # (OPTIONAL)Secondary Backend configuration for connecting to
# # all kind of Rational Database Management System (RDBMS) backend and 
# # search engine (SE) backend like Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.
# # You can uncomment one of the following sections based on the 
# # backend you want to connect to.

# # In the following examples we generally consider the native

# limit_offset = "LIMIT :limit OFFSET :offset" # IMPORTANT: One can specify the limit and offset variables based on the database-specific syntax

# [secondary-backend.lookuptable]
# # secondary-backend.lookuptable section defines the lookup table 
# # mapping between secondary backend fields and the data search params
# # used in the Freva-API.
