# - `databrowser`: Enables the search functionality, allowing users to search
#   and retrieve metadata related to available datasets.
# - `zarr-stream`: Provides streaming access to data in Zarr format, suitable
#   for large, multi-dimensional arrays often used in scientific data.
# By default, both services are enabled. Remove a service from the list
# to disable it if not required for your API instance.

# is accessed publicly via `https://www.my-server.org`, set `proxy` to
# "https://www.my-server.org". Leave this empty if no reverse proxy is used.
