"""## Welcome to the RestAPI for freva 🧉

Freva, the free evaluation system framework, is a data search and analysis
platform developed by the atmospheric science community for the atmospheric
science community. With help of Freva researchers can:

- quickly and intuitively search for data stored at typical data centers that
  host many datasets.
- create a common interface for user defined data analysis tools.
- apply data analysis tools in a reproducible manner.

### Authentication

The API supports token-based authentication using OAuth2. To obtain an access
token, clients can use the `/api/freva/auth/v2/token` endpoint by providing valid
username and password credentials. The access token should then be included in
the Authorization header for secured endpoints.
